# Browser Add-on Activity

Note1: students work in groups of 3. The instructions indicate which parts of this activity should be performed 
by all team-members and which should be performed by one team member. 

Note2: students do not need to be familiar with Javascript in order to complete this activity 

Prerequisite: Firefox should be installed on your system. 

The Mozilla Developers Network has 
a tutorial on [Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) that 
you will be using during this activity. 

## Part 1: Creating and installing your very first Firefox extension 

- locate the _Your First Extension_ link under the _Getting Started Section_ in the 
[Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) tutorial 
- each student should follow the steps to create this very simple extension 
(feel free to modify the color and/or the domain)  
- once finished, help out your other team members 

When you are __all__ done, let the facilitator know. 

## Part 2: Creating and installing a more sofisticated extension 

- locate the _Your Second Extension_ link under the _Getting Started Section_ in the 
[Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) tutorial 
- each student should follow the steps to create this very simple extension (feel free to modify the images used) 
- once finished, help out your other team members 

When you are __all__ done, let the facilitator know. 

## Part 3: Repository exploration 

When you were working on the previous part, you should have encountered references to the 
[MDN WebExtension repository](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples). 
Go to that repository and locate the following files: LICENSE, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,  
and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. Answer the questions below as a team. Your answers should be placed under heading
_Part 3_ in a file called
`team_NUMBER.md` (where `NUMBER` is replaced by your team number) in the repository called `activity1` in the 
course organization. 

1. What is the purpose of the README.md file? What kind of information should be included there?
2. What is the purpose of the LICENSE file? Does it need to be in a repository?
3. What is the purpose of the CONTRIBUTING.md file? 
4. Describe one type of contribution to this repository that does not require writing any code. 
5. What is the purpose of the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md document? 
6. Describe three types of behaviors that violate the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines. 
7. If a person working with the contect of this repository runs into problems or has questions, what can they do? 

When you are done, let the facilitator know. 

## Part 4: Explore existing extensions  

Go to [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) page. As a team, decide on your _favorite_ 
extension. List the name and the link to that extension in your team's file in the `activity1` repository
under the heading _Part 4_. Then answer the following questions about your chosen extension. 

1. What is the homepage for the extension?
2. What is the license under which the extension is distributed?
3. Can you find a code repository for this extension? 
4. Is the extension that you picked an open source project? 
5. Can you find information about how many different users contribute to this project? If so, specify how many. 

When you are done, let the facilitator know. 

## Part 5: Create your own 

As a team, create an idea for an extension. It can be a very simple one, or a more complicated one (this idea can 
evolve in the course of this semester). 

- Create a repository in the class organization with the name of your extension. In your team's file for `activity1` 
provide a link to that repository under heading _Part 5_. 
- Create a README.md file with a description of the idea for your extension. 
- Create other files that will make this an open soure project. 

When you are done, let the facilitator know.
