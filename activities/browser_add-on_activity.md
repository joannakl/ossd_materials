  git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
  ```
  (The email should be the same email you used to register your GitHub account. Your name should be your name or nickname      - just make sure that it is proper and recognizable since it will be associated with all of your commits.  It can be your GitHub username. ) <br>

  ```
  git config --global user.email "joannakl@cs.nyu.edu"
  git config --global user.name "JoannaKl"```<br>

The Mozilla Developers Network has
a tutorial on [Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) that
you will be using during this activity.

## Part 1: Creating and installing your very first Firefox extension

- Each team member should  locate the _Your first extension_ link under the _Getting Started Section_ in the
[Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) tutorial.
- Each team member should follow the steps to create this very simple extension
(feel free to modify the color and/or the domain).
- Once you finish, help out your other team members.

When you are __all__ done, let the facilitator (your instructor) know.

## Part 2: Creating and installing a more sophisticated extension

- Each team member should  locate the _Your second extension_ link under the _Getting Started Section_ in the
[Browser Extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) tutorial
- Each student should follow the steps to create this very simple extension (feel free to modify the images used).
- Once you finish, help out your other team members.

When you are __all__ done, let the facilitator  know.

## Part 3: Repository exploration

When you were working on the previous part, you should have encountered references to the
[MDN WebExtension repository](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples).
Go to that repository and locate the following files: LICENSE, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
Answer the questions below as a team. Your answers should be placed under the heading
_Part 3_ in a file named
`team_NUMBER.md` (where `NUMBER` is replaced by your team number) that your team should create in the repository named `firefox-addon-activity` in the
course organization.

1. What is the purpose of the `README.md` file? What kind of information should be included in it?
2. What is the purpose of the `LICENSE` file? Does it need to be in a repository?
3. What is the purpose of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file?
4. Describe one type of contribution to this repository that does not require writing any code.
5. What is the purpose of the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` document?
6. Describe three types of behaviors that violate the _Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines_.
7. If a person working with the content of this repository runs into problems or has questions, what can they do?

When your group is done, let the facilitator know.

## Part 4: Explore existing extensions

Go to the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) page. As a team, decide on your _favorite_
extension. Write its name and the link to that extension in your team's file in the `firefox-addon-activity` repository
under the heading _Part 4_. Then answer the following questions about your chosen extension.

1. What is the homepage for the extension?
2. What is the license under which the extension is distributed?
3. Can you find a code repository for this extension?
4. Is the extension that you picked an open source project?
5. Can you find information about how many different users contribute to this project? If so, specify how many.

When your group is done, let the facilitator know.

## Part 5: Create your own extension

As a team, create an idea for an extension. It can be a very simple one, or a more complicated one.

- Create a public repository in the class organization with the name of your extension.
In your team's file in the `firefox-addon-activity`, provide a link to that repository under the heading _Part 5_.
- Create a `README.md` file with a description of the idea for your extension.
- Create other files that will make this an open soure project.

When your group is done, let the facilitator know.
