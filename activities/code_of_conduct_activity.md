# Code of Conduct Activity

Many open source projects provide very clear guidance and requirements for the
proper behavior and conduct of the member of the community.
But there are many projects that do not have explicit rules (even though they
may still expect courteous behavior from the community members).  

The documents describing proper code of conduct may be located on the project's
website or in the repository (or both). In some cases they are not easy to
find even though they do exist.

## Instructions for students
### Part 1

Visit the [code of conduct document](https://golang.org/conduct) for the [Go project](https://golang.org/). Read the document carefully.
In your own words explain the benefits of having such a document for a project.
Do you think other projects would benefit from having such a document?

Follow the link at the bottom of the above document to [the Contributor
Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) website.
Find two differences between the two code of conduct documents. Try to explain
why the Go project might have made those changes.

The Contributor Covenant website has a list of projects that adapted their code
of conduct. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) is one of the listed projects.
Try to find the code of conduct document for Eclipse. Post the link as part of your
answer. You will discover that this document has different structure and content
than the one for the Go project. Try to explain why that is.


### Part 2

Visit the [code of conduct document](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct) for the
[Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/) project. Note that it is located in the legal
section of their wiki page.

Read through this document. Compare it to the code of conduct for the Go project.
Is this document based on another code of conduct?

### Part 3

Pick an open source project. (It could be a project that you are familiar with, or
a project that you are interested in, or something you encountered in one of the
class discussions). Try to find the code of conduct document for that project.
Note that it may not have a code of conduct or that it may be called differently.
Include a link to it (if you find it) and compare it to the two "templates" that
you looked at in parts 1 and 2. If the project does not have a code of conduct document,
write a proposal for such a document.
