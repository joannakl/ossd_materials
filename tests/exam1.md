Consider a remote repository containing several files. Jane and John both have administrative access to that repository.
They both clone the repository and work with their local copies. Initially their local repositories are identical.

  Jane creates a new file called `file_Jane.md`, adds it to her local repository and pushes it.
  Will there be a merge conflict when Jane attempts to make her push? Explain. If there is a merge conflict, describe how
  it should be resolved.
